## Very common problem

#### Seafile/Seahub can't start after upgrade or any other reasons

Please check whether the old version of Seahub is still running.

Please check whether you use the right user to run or upgrade Seafile. Pay special attention to the following files:

* `seafile-directory/seafile-server-6.0.3/runtime/error.log`
* `seafile-directory/seafile-server-6.0.3/runtime/access.log`
* `seafile-directory/logs/*`

You can run the following command to change fix the permission for the whole directory:

```
chown -R userx:groupx seafiledirectory
```

You can also try remove the cache directory of Seahub

```
rm -rf /tmp/seahub_cache
```
